    // with verbosity=2, it prints out each domain of the variables in addition.

    // Comment the algorithm code liberally. Include a link to the paper or reference you used for the pseudocode of
    // the algorithm e.g., “Used pseudocode from Figure 1 of https://cdn.aaai.org/ICAPS/2005/ICAPS05-010.pdf”).
    // Your comments should note the connections between the code and the pseudocode, like “This block
    // implements finding the best nodes in the open list (line 1 of the pseudocode)”.
